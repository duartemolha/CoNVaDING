# CoNVaDING_reload

This is a fork of the original project CoNVaDING
That project is the official one and I make no claims to be a replacement of it.

If you want to follow the official project please go to:

This fork was created by Duarte Molha to implement features not provided by the original project.

You can read more about how it differs from the original software here:
